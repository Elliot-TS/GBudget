# CSC 324 SGA Assisting Tool

Repo for SGA Assisting Tool Sp 24 CSC-324 Project.

The top-level README should briefly describe the idea and goals of your project and explain the layout of the repository. Include a link to your issue tracking tool and a description of how you will use your tool to track issues for each sprint.

## Idea

Make a web application to improve the workflow and processes of submission, review, and approval of budget proposals to the SGA Treasurer. The app would allow student organization to submit their event budget, get it approved, and all on a timeline by using a calendar application (or API) in one place. The app will enforce SGAâ€™s scheduling timeline making sure that organizations are on time and getting their need met accordingly.


## Goals

- Implement web app and interface that allows student organization to submit their event budget and get it approved.
- Make a user-friendly, easy to use, and inclusive interface.
- Provide tools and automated procedures to help make the process of creating, submitting, and reviewing budget requests easier and faster.
- Provide resources to help students new to the procedures of submitting budget requests.

## Issue Tracking

Link to Issue Tracking Tool: [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/hfm58bcT/ATTI6cf82e3a6ed83c2febcd910d11c8363a47A90D48/issue-board)

We are going use the Trello Board to track our backlog and the issues we are working on and/or completed for each sprint. 

Our `Backlog` will contain upcoming tasks or work left over from the previous week. Tasks for the current Sprint will be assigned to individual team members and placed in the `In Progress` section. Once each task is done, it'll be moved to the `Done - Sprint X` for that week's Sprint. During Sprint Planning meetings, we will create new issues if our `Backlog` is empty or breakdown issues in our `Backlog` if they are too big
