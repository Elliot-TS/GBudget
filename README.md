To run the code locally, `clone` the repository, run `npm install` to install dependencies in the repo directory and run `npm run dev` to start a local server. More detailed instructions are available for building and testing the project are available in the [wiki](https://github.com/csc-324-sga-assisting-tool/csc-324-sga-assisting-tool/wiki)

### Operational Parts

- The dashboard page which lets users see the budgets they have so far and add new budgets 
- Help page

*While the components are interactive, the actual data and information in the help page are placeholders*

## Idea

Make a web application to improve the workflow and processes of submission, review, and approval of budget proposals to the SGA Treasurer. The app would allow student organization to submit their event budget, get it approved, and all on a timeline by using a calendar application (or API) in one place. The app will enforce SGAâ€™s scheduling timeline making sure that organizations are on time and getting their need met accordingly.

## Goals

- Implement web app and interface that allows student organization to submit their event budget and get it approved.
- Make a user-friendly, easy to use, and inclusive interface.
- Provide tools and automated procedures to help make the process of creating, submitting, and reviewing budget requests easier and faster.
- Provide resources to help students new to the procedures of submitting budget requests.

## Issue Tracking

Link to Issue Tracking Tool: [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/hfm58bcT/ATTI6cf82e3a6ed83c2febcd910d11c8363a47A90D48/issue-board)

We are going use the Trello Board to track our backlog and the issues we are working on and/or completed for each sprint.

Our `Backlog` will contain upcoming tasks or work left over from the previous week. Tasks for the current Sprint will be assigned to individual team members and placed in the `In Progress` section. Once each task is done, it'll be moved to the `Done - Sprint X` for that week's Sprint. During Sprint Planning meetings, we will create new issues if our `Backlog` is empty or breakdown issues in our `Backlog` if they are too big

## Repo Layout

- `src/` or `lib/` : contains the source code for the app
- `dist/` : contains output files (like our code after compilation)
- `test/` : contains tests for our app

- Sprint documents can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/csc-324-sga-assisting-tool/csc-324-sga-assisting-tool/wiki)

## Style

We will be following Google's TypeScript Style Guide for this repo. See more details on the [wiki](https://github.com/csc-324-sga-assisting-tool/csc-324-sga-assisting-tool/wiki) which includes instructions on how to set up and use the automated linter
